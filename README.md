  *"Boost Your Crystal Model with Denoising Pre-training"*

- ðŸŒŸ **Presented at [AAAI Conference 2025 ï¼ˆto appearï¼‰](https://aaai.org/)**  
  *"A Denoising Pre-training Framework for Accelerating Material Discovery"*

## Dataset

Dataset used for pre-training can be found at [GNoME](https://github.com/google-deepmind/materials_discovery).

## Training and Prediction

You can train and test the model with the following commands:

```bash
conda env create -f DPF.yaml
conda activate DPF
cd matformer
bash pretrain.sh
```

For training your own custom models, you only need to replace the model with your own.
